# KML_to_CSV_convertor
               
## Idea Behind It
###           In today's life almost all the people is travelling to some unknown or known place                                                    
###           and most of the time they need navigation and mostly prefer Google Maps for navigation.                                                          
###           So as lots of people are travelling there are lots of research and project going on in                                   
###           which they need coordinate data of routes or coordinate of source or destination.                                     
###           If someone is going to download route data from google map it will be in basically                                             
###           KML form and we need it to convert to CSV for further use. There are few online websites                                                      
###           that convert KML to CSV file but here comes the issue of data securities because we need                                                          
###           to upload our KML file to such website and then they will convert and you can download it.                                                           
###           But here I am posting easy Python code that can be used for this type of purpose.


##            Library Use                    
            -> Pandas
            -> BeautifulSoup                       
            -> pykml

            ->KML File                                        
##           Output -:
